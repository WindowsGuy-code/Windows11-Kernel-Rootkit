# Windows-11 Kernel Rootkit
A Windows 11 Rootkit driver - currently no dropper involved.

## About
This is as said a kernel Rootkit driver hiding any Processes or files you don't want people seeing.
It also has some more functions involved like a BSOD and (offcourse) a hooking function called CloudHook.

It is highly customizable by simple editing of lists and variables in the code or configuring it via the hpp file **defs**.
It is built to *bypass* any Sys Admin Tool and may (if you choose) trigger a BlueScreen when one opens, 
it isnt suggested to activate this function since it may rise suspicion and since **NtQuerySystemInformation** is already edited it will already be hidden.

## Config ‚öôÔ∏è
You need to enable BSOD in the defs.hpp file. You can also enable other stuff like:
- File Hiding (Enable / Disable)
- Process Hiding (Enable / Disable)
- Process Hide Items (List)
- File Hide Items (List)
  On default File Hiding and Process Hiding are enabled. BSOD is disabled and the lists are just
  "mocks" a few are real processes but I suggest to edit it and add you're own stuff.

## Working on it...
I am working on a dropper/planter using an kernel exploit by [Milad Karimi](https://www.exploit-db.com/?author=10413):      [Kernel Exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52275)

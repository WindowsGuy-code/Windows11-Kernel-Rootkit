# Windows-11 Kernel Rootkit
A Windows 11 Rootkit - in progress üîß

## About
This is as said a kernel Rootkit driver hiding any Processes or files you don't want people seeing.

It is highly customizable by simple editing of lists and variables in the code or configuring it via the hpp file **defs**.
It is built to *bypass* any Sys Admin Tool and may (if you choose) trigger a BlueScreen when one opens, 
it isnt suggested to activate this BSOD function since it may rise suspicion and since **ZwQuerySystemInformation** is already edited it will already be hidden.

## Config ‚öôÔ∏è
You need to enable BSOD in the defs.hpp file (If you want to). You can also enable other stuff like:
- File Hiding (Enable / Disable)
- Process Hiding (Enable / Disable)
- Process Hide Items (List)
- File Hide Items (List)
- Enable hiding Registry Keys (Enable / Disable)
- Registry Keys Items (List)
- Debug Mode (Enable / Disable)
- Delay Execution (Enable / Disable)
- Delay Time (Number)  
  On default File Hiding and Process Hiding are enabled also the driver is hidden in the Registry (if enabled). BSOD is disabled and the lists are just
  "mocks" and a few are real processes but I suggest to edit it and add you're own stuff.
  The delay time **must** be in 100 units of nanoseconds.
  The Debug Mode is disabled on default but it logs everything it currently does by using DbgPrint wich can be found in *defs.hpp* ;p.

## delivery.cs
This file is a mockup of what a Payload delivery might look like for this rootkit. It needs a actual usable download link ofcourse.
Might not be the best since it is my first ever c-sharp project.

## BTW
I highly suggest reading the comments in the USER CONFIGURATION since otherwise you might understand something wrong;
If you want to host a site to curl and download the rootkit you will probaly have to change some of the folder logic.  
Not everything is optimised üòâ.

## Recently finished ‚úÖ
- Payload delivery example (delivery.cs)
- UAC Bypass (delivery.cs)
- Debug Mode (Everything)
- Time Delay (defs.hpp)
- Added InfinityHookProMax for hooking

## Working on it...
I am currently working on a better exploit (Current one has been patched, this will take a while) and adding comments explaining everything...
